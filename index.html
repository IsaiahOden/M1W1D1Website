    <p>
        Isaiah Oden has a diverse background spanning entrepreneurship, emergency response, and nonprofit operations. 
        With four years in early-stage entrepreneurship, he led student engagement initiatives, hired and trained teams, and organized events. 
        He then served as a firefighter/EMT-B for nearly two years before moving into nonprofit operations as an operational analyst, where he managed Power Automate flows, wrote grants, researched partnerships, and supported events. 
        Now, he’s focused on expanding his technical skills as a student at CodeCrew Code School, working on full-stack web development, data analysis, and AI. 
        A fun fact—one of his bucket list goals is to have at least one professional or amateur fight.
